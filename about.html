<div class="aboutme">
	<p>Hello, <br>
	   Welcome to my potfolio website.<br>
	   My name is Sean Keely and I am 18 years old. I am in my second semester of my first year as a creative didgital media student in Technological University Dublin (TUD). In my course we study topics that range from film making to web development and even all the way to graphic design. The course benefits me as I get to experience an array of things I would of never thought possible.<br>
	   <br>
	   On this website portfolio you will be able to see examples of the work I have completed from different modules over the last several months.
